This project was part of Google Data Analyitcs Professional Certificate.
The theme and the questions was proposed.
The rest of the work is completely my work and my own strategies from scratch without further indications.

The initial datasets were collected from excel files in the internet, I had to create one single dataset which had a size 
of 6 GB and which of course I cannot add on GitHub because of memory restrictions.

The tools used were: R, Excel, SQLite.

The contents of the file are as follows:

1. Start with introduction-conclusions directory.
2. This directory contains introduction.pdf where you will understand the objective of the project.
3. conclusions.pdf contains the answers.
4. The rest of the files contains the code I used and the respective graphics I obtained with the produced datasets views.

5. The files SQL, R and excel contains the respective codes.

6. tableau contains the final dashboards.
