1. Saving excel files as CSV because of excel problems when importing to R: bikes_2021 <- excel_files

2. Created biDatasetCSV-12Months.R

3. Created CSV dataset with the twelve months: bikes_2022 <- bigDatasetCSV.csv

4. Created database in SQLite: bikes_2021 <- bigDatasetCSV.db

5. Created FILE: SQL.

6. Created files: SQL <- CSV-FromQueries and SQL <- queries. This files containes the queries made in SQLite and the tables obtained.

1. There is a problem with the bigDatasetCSV.db, the SQL query is not reading monts 3 and 10.

2. Problem in 1.: when importing with R the format start_date column was changed and it wasnÂ´t unified. Solution: I formatted the start_date column in the csv files as Year-Month-Day.

1.5 calculatingPercentageByGroup-Mmonth-RideableType.sql
1.6 calculatingPercentageByGroup-Mmonth-Weekday.sql
1.7 calculatingPercentageByGroup-ride_duration_hours.sql
1.8 calculatingPercentageByGroup-ride_duration_hours-Month.sql
1.9 PercentageByGroupAndMmonth-proof2.sql
1.10 percentageByWeekdayByRider.sql

2. I stored the results of the last queries in SQL <- CSV-FromQueries

2.1 calculationPercentageByGroupAndMonth.csv
2.2 calculationPercentageByGroup-Month-RideableType.csv
2.3 percentageByGroup.csv
2.4 PercentageByGroupAndHours.csv
2.5 PercentageByGroup-Hours-Month.csv
2.6 PercentageByGroup-ride_duration_Hours.csv
2.7 PercentageByGroup-ride_duration_Hours-Month.csv
2.8 percentageByMonth-Weekday-TypeOfRider.csv
2.9 percentageByTypeOfRyder.csv
2.10 percentageByWeekdayByTypeOfRider.csv
